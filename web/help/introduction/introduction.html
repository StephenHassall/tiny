  <h3>What Is The Tiny Web Application Framework?</h3>
  <p>
    There are many JavaScript frameworks that help you create web applications.
    They all have their own unique ways of doing things, but they all have one thing in common, they are large and complex.
    Our goal is to use existing web standards and technologies, mainly Web Components, to help you create web applications without a framework.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sadly, you cannot really create a web application using only Web Components, so it was necessary to create a small set of helper classes. 
  </p>
  <p>
    There is no need to spend hours learning something that will go out of date in a year’s time.
    The Tiny Web Application Framework is small, very quick to pick up and get started with, and because it is based off web standards, it wouldn’t get old quick.
  </p>

  <h3>What You Need To Know First</h3>
  <p>
    You will need to know how to use JavaScript, HTML, CSS and have some understanding of Web Components.
    Some knowledge relating to ES6 (import, export, class, etc) will be helpful too.
  </p>

  <h3>How Does It Work</h3>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Runs in the browser.</li>
      <li>Create your own Controller classes that load in HTML and CSS files.</li>
      <li>Format HTML using JavaScript ${...} string template literal notations.</li>
      <li>Transfer data between inputs and data.</li>
      <li>No build tools.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Where To Get It</h3>

  <p>
    You can go to the Tiny GitHub repository from <a class="source-link" href="https://github.com/StephenHassall/tiny">here</a>.
